I made this in Grade 8 in my free time, over the course of about 8 months IIRC. I was 13 when I completed it.

It's a blend of FPS and Tower Defense, and it features 3 maps, 5 turret types, 6 guns, and many enemy types.

There's lots I would change about it now, but I think it's important to keep it archived as it was when I finished it.
I pretty much just uploaded it here to have a permanent archive of it, but if you for some reason make modification or change, I'd love to see it!
